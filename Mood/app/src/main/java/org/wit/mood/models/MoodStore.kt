 * Defines the contract for a Mood data store (Repository layer).

 * must provide basic CRUD functionality for [MoodModel] objects.

 * This abstraction allows you to:
 * - Swap storage implementations easily (e.g., JSON â†’ Room DB)
 * - Keep Activities independent from data storage details
 * - Follow clean architecture principles (separation of concerns)
